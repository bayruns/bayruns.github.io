hey there. this is the starting point of "One Man's Trash", a cross between the unapologetic tomfoolery of “Untitled Goose Game” and the dungeon crawling, progression-based structure of “Hades”. instead of battling underworld denizens, we’re out here knocking over trash cans, creating messes, and...other stuff (TBD).

in each level of “One Man’s Trash”, our raccoon hero will wreak havoc in various establishments - museums, shops, supermarkets - basically anywhere fun and filled with things to knock over. the boy's got a simple goal: stir up enough chaos to claim each level as his own. with each mess made, the chaos meter goes up and the closer our raccoon gets to victory.

through this devlog, I'll be bringing you along for the ride. from the brainstorming of mechanics to the nitty-gritty details of the stealth system, it'll all be laid out here. expect progress updates, occasional sneak peeks, and a candid look at the highs and lows of game development.

stick around. it's about to get mildly interesting.
